This week, we reviewed Object Oriented Programming in Python and learned a few basic data structures and abstract data types. So far, many of the terms and concepts are familiar, although I have not explored them deeply. It was also interesting to explore a few NP-Complete Problems and Big O Notation after the class. 

I figured out a method of taking notes that works best for me by using a combination of Notion and Jupyter Notebooks in VSCode. This allows me to explain and evaluate code simultaneously.
