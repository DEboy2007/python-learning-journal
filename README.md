# python-learning-journal
A repository to document my Python learning journey

### About Me
My name is Dhanush Ekollu and I am a senior at Saratoga High. The first project I made with code was an app called "Water Wise" in 5th grade to help people save water. I've loved coding since, and regularly participate in hackathons and make personal projects to learn more. I am especially passionate about Artificial Intelligence, specifically Computer Vision and its applications in medicine. Currently, I am researching how to evaluate doctor-patient interactions using computer vision at Stanford CERC!

### Goals for this Course
My primary goal for this course is to learn fundamental data structures and algorithms so I am well prepared for CS courses in college. Although I have coded for a long time, I never received a formal introduction to algorithms. I hope the material I learn in this course makes me better at common interview questions and general problem solving.

### My First Python Program
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
